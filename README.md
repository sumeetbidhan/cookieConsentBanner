# Cookie Consent Banner

This repository contains a simple Cookie Consent Banner built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The banner informs users about the use of cookies and asks for their consent. The user's consent is stored in the browser using `localStorage` to ensure the banner doesn't reappear on subsequent page visits.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into three main files:

1. **`index.html`**: The main HTML structure for the banner and the page.
2. **`styles.css`**: The styling of the cookie banner and page.
3. **`script.js`**: JavaScript for managing DOM elements, event handling, and persistence using `localStorage`.

## How to Run the Project

1. Save the above files in the same directory:
   - `index.html`
   - `styles.css`
   - `script.js`
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. The banner will show up when the page loads.
4. Click "Accept" to hide the banner and persist consent.
5. Reload the page to confirm that the banner does not reappear.

## Learning Outcomes

- **HTML**: Structure of the banner.
- **CSS**: Styling and animations.
- **JavaScript**: DOM manipulation, event handling, and persistence using `localStorage`.
